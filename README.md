# Ansible
I'll try automate some routine tasks for practice and enahce them as I can. I'll appreciate to participate and collaborate with me.
Due to do this practices I prefer read other projects that have done in advance, so I can save time and customize them.
My major distro is debian 12, but try to test another popular distros like ubuntu and rocky.
